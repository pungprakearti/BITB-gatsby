This is a repo for my personal site: www.biscuitsinthebasket.com

The site was built with Gatsby on React and is hosted on Netlify.

Todo list:
1. ~~Contact icon on homepage doesn't seem to have a color associated with it
2. ~~Resume should scale a bit as screen gets smaller
3. Add more data visualization stuff to the algorithms page
4. ~~Make lipslut data visualization larger
5. ~~Fix spacing on bottom of each page
