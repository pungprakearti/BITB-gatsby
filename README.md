This is a repo for my personal site: www.biscuitsinthebasket.com

The site was built with Gatsby on React and is hosted on Netlify.

Todo list:
1. ~~Contact icon on homepage doesn't seem to have a color associated with it~~
2. ~~Resume should scale a bit as screen gets smaller~~
3. Add more data visualization stuff to the algorithms page
4. ~~Make lipslut data visualization larger~~
5. ~~Fix spacing on bottom of each page~~
6. make a max width for the nav bar
7. change typography
8. make new layouts for large screens
9. change colors of icons on mobile nav bar
10. change colors on icons in general
